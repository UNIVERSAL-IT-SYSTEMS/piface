<title>a boot monitor for the Raspberry Pi</title>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

piface is a very simple but hopefully useful boot monitor for the Raspberry
Pi. Unlike most other Raspberry Pi software, it runs directly on the
Videocore CPU rather than on the ARM coprocessor. This means you can use
it to run Videocore programs directly on the bare metal without having to
use the ARM-Videocore APIs.

piface uses the mini-UART as a serial terminal.

Right now piface's feature set is fairly thin as the capabilities of the
Videocore side of the Pi are still being investigated, but it supports:

  *  uploads and downloads via XMODEM
  *  executing code
  *  modifying and dumping memory
  *  lots of plumbing for more interesting stuff later

Regarding that last, if anyone knows how the MMC interface works, please
get in touch...

<h3>What's new?</h3>

2013-06-21: Version 0.3 released! Added basic read-write SD card support.

2013-06-18: Version 0.2.1 released! Fixed a very embarrassing bug in
the compiler startup code which was putting the stack in the wrong place.

2013-06-13: Version 0.2 released! Now with (barely tested) XMODEM
receive, so you can send data from the PC to the Pi.

2013-06-07: Version 0.1 released! The first actually useful version.
For certain values of useful, of course.

<h3>Where can I get it?</h3>

Most likely what you want is the precompiled binary:

<blockquote class='link'>
<a href='../../../doc/stable/bin/piface-0.3.bin.gz'>
  <img class='link-img' height='22' width='20' alt='[BIN]' src='//cowlark.com/binary.png'>
</a>
<a href='../../../doc/stable/bin/piface-0.3.bin.gz'>piface-0.3.bin.gz</a>
<p>Version 0.3 precompiled binary.</p>
</blockquote>

The source code is available here:

<blockquote class='link'>
<a href='../../../tarball/piface-0.3.tar.gz?uuid=release-0.3'>
  <img class='link-img' height='22' width='20' alt='[BIN]' src='//cowlark.com/binary.png'>
</a>
<a href='../../../tarball/piface-0.3.tar.gz?uuid=release-0.3'>piface-0.3.tar.gz</a>
<p>Version 0.3 source code.</p>
</blockquote>

However,
In addition, you can download
an <a href="../../../tarball/piface-tip.tar.gz?uuid=tip">the latest version
from the VCS</a>. This is not guaranteed to work, or even to build. I'd
recommend using the formal release above.

Another way of getting the version under development is by
checking out the source repository using <a href="http://fossil-scm.org">the
Fossil DVCS</a>. Use the following commands:

<verbatim>fossil clone http://cowlark.com/piface piface.fossil
mkdir piface
fossil open ../piface.fossil
</verbatim>

piface builds with a special development version of <a href="http://tack.sf.net">The
Amsterdam Compiler Kit</a>, modified to generate (rather crude) Videocore IV
machine code. This is easy but not trivial; if you're interested, email me
and ask.

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>

Copy your chosen <tt>piface.bin</tt> file to <tt>bootcode.bin</tt> on a FAT
formatted SD card. Insert card into Raspberry Pi and apply power. piface runs!

To actually interact with it, you'll need to connect the mini UART on the Pi
to a PC. You can find <a href="http://jeffskinnerbox.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/raspberry-pi-serial-communication/">information
here</a>. <b>Important note!</b> The mini UART on the Pi is a 3.3V device. If
you wire it directly to a PC serial port, you are very likely to explode your
Pi. You will need an adapter. I recommend <a href="http://adafruit.com/products/954">USB
serial adapters</a> for this.

Once set up, connect your serial terminal at 115200 baud 8N1, and when you
start the Pi you should see:

PiFace v0.3 (c) 2013 David Given

</pre>

You can now type commands. Here are some useful ones:

  *  To dump memory to the console: <code>dump mem:80000000+200</code>
  *  To change memory: <code>poke byte 8000000 1 2 3 4</code>
  *  To download some data via XMODEM: <code>send mem:80000000+10000</code>
  *  To upload some data via XMODEM: <code>recv mem:60008000</code>
  *  To copy data to a file: <code>cp mem:80000000+10000 sd:data.img</code>
  *  To copy data from a file: <code>cp sd:data.img mem:60008000</code>
  *  To start execution at a particular address: <code>go 0</code>
  *  To get generic help: <code>help</code>

piface uses an internal VFS; <code>mem:</code> and <code>sd:</code> are
supported.

<code>mem:</code> files refer to an arbitrary
block of memory, using a filename of the form <code>mem:address+length</code>.
You may also
use <code>mem:address</code> for unbounded memory regions, but be careful of
this (because they're 4GB long and will take a while to dump to the console).

<code>sd:</code> files refer to files on a FAT filesystem on the SD card.
(The <code>ls</code> command is useful here.) Most FAT filesystems on LBA
partitions should work. Cards are hot-swappable while piface is showing the
command line prompt; both SDHC and ordinary SD cards are supported (but
probably not MMC cards). The filesystem is writeable --- it hasn't corrupted
my cards yet, but <i>you have been warned</i>. Performance is currently pretty
lousy and it hasn't had much testing.

If you try to do something to an unmapped memory region, or if you corrupt
piface's workspace, piface will let you know by crashing. Power cycle the Pi
to reset.

<h4>On XMODEM</h4>

You can use XMODEM to transfer data to/from piface. The details will depend
on which terminal emulator you're using. Normally, after issuing the piface
<code>send</code> or <code>recv</code> command, you'll then issue the
appropriate local command and the transfer will proceed.

If you're using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU screen</a>,
which is my preferred least bad terminal emulator, you can do this by
installing the venerable <a href="http://ohse.de/uwe/software/lrzsz.html">lrzsz</a>
package. Then, to send a file, do:

<pre>^A :!!! sx -bk file.img
</pre>

...and to receive a file, do:

<pre>^A :!!! rx -bc file.img
</pre>

(^A means to type a CTRL+A to get the screen's command line.) The parameters
are important. <code>-b</code> sets binary mode, which prevents mangled
transfers; <code>-k</code> sets 1kB blocks; <code>-c</code> uses 16-bit CRCs
(which also prevents mangled transfers).

<h4>Technical details</h4>

When the Raspberry Pi starts, there's 128kB of RAM at 80000000, which is
where piface is loaded. piface then initialises the mini UART but does not
attempt to change the PLLs or set up the SDRAM.

The internal boot ROM is mapped at 60000000. There's 0x800 bytes of RAM at
60008000, which is useful for playing with. However, be wary of the area at
about 60008000 to 60008048, as this is where the second core's stack lives.
While the second core <i>should</i> be idling and unresponsive, I can't
guarantee it...

Peripherals are mapped at 7e000000. You can manipulate them with <tt>poke</tt> if
you're really careful. Note that <tt>dump</tt> always reads bytes.

<h3>Why shouldn't I use it?</h3>

You cannot do anything useful with piface yet. You cannot do anything useful
with the Videocore side of the Raspberry Pi yet. The only purpose that piface
has is to make it easier to poke the Videocore to find out how it works. If
this is the sort of thing that interests you, then piface is for you. If not,
stay well clear (and use the ARM instead).

In addition, piface is very new and is probably riddled with bugs. Find
any? Let me know by <a href="../../../tktnew">filing a bug</a> (it'll ask you
to log in; you can either create an account or log in as anonymous).

<h3>Who wrote it?</h3>

I, <a href="http://cowlark.com">David Given</a>, wrote it. Got any comments,
criticism, cake? Send it to <a href="mailto:dg@cowlark.com">dg@cowlark.com</a>.
If there's interest, I'll set up a mailing list.
